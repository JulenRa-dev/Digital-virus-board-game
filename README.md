# Digital-virus-board-game
The classic "virus" board game made with Python

This is meant for you to do whatever you want with this project. You can mod it to add new cards, make the game difficult. I made a board game moddable after all! If you encounter any issues with the unmodded project please tell me about it in the issues tab.

Dependences for playing:

Python 3.8 or newer. Just download it at [the official python website](https://www.python.org/)

Ursina engine: You can download it from [here](https://github.com/pokepetter/ursina) or just use "pip install ursina" to install the latest stable version
